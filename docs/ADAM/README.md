# ADAM (Ambidextrous Domestic Autonomous Manipulator)

ADAM is a robot designed to perform everyday tasks for people who have difficulties carrying out such tasks. To achieve this, ADAM is equipped with various sensors and actuators that allow it to understand its surroundings and interact with them, giving it direct utility in the actions it can perform. For these processes, ADAM aims to be a development and coordination platform between different modules that enable its use in novel environments. The main research areas with ADAM are:

[**Navigation**](../Navigation/demo.md): ADAM is capable of moving autonomously in indoor environments, avoiding obstacles and reaching the desired location. The main lines of research are:
- Localiziation: ADAM is equipped with sensors that allow it to know its position in the environment.

[**Vision**](../Vision/demo.md): ADAM is equipped with cameras and LIDAR sensors that allow it to perceive its surroundings and interact with them.

[**Manipulation**](../Manipulation/demo.md): ADAM has two robotic arms that allows it to interact with objects in its environment.

[**Grasping**](../Grasping/demo.md): ADAM has a gripper that allows it to grasp objects and manipulate them.

**Simulation** ADAM is equipped with a simulation environment that allows it to test its algorithms in a virtual environment before deploying them in the real world.
